# FaceStar: Celebrity Classification for Actor Recognition

FaceStar is a project designed to classify celebrity faces and recognize actors using advanced techniques in image processing and machine learning. This project demonstrates the use of face detection, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to deliver accurate results.

## Project Features
- **Celebrity Classification**: Identify which celebrity or actor is in a given image.
- **Face Detection**: Use Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces in images.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilize wavelet transform for extracting meaningful features from facial images.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement classification models to predict the identity of the actor.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly web application interface.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Images of celebrities were scraped and preprocessed.
   - Ensured dataset balance for effective training.
2. **Face Detection**:
   - Applied Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces and eyes in images.
3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Used wavelet transform to extract rich features from facial images.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Trained machine learning model for actor classification.
5. **Deployment**:
   - Built an interactive Streamlit app for users to upload images and get predictions.


## Usage
- Upload an image of a celebrity or actor.
- The app detects faces, extracts features, and classifies the actor.
- Results are displayed instantly with a confidence score.
